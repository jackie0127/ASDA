# 🌍 Global Well-Being Data Analysis

## 👋 Introduction

Hi! I’m Shreyas Krishnamurthy, a Computer Science and Engineering student passionate about Data Science and Analytics.  
This repository contains three Kaggle datasets selected to study global happiness, health, and mental well-being.  
Through these datasets, I aim to analyze how social, economic, and health factors influence people’s lives worldwide.
